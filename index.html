	<p>In the 21st century, technology is omnipresent in our lives. With a boom in the technology sector, it is proving to be a lucrative career opportunity for students, who are in the juncture to pass out from school and are considering various aspects for their future career option.Computer Science Engineering is the most popular course for the Engineering aspirants. During the counselling of the top engineering colleges, the Computer Science Engineering seats are the fastest filled among different branches.
 
This article of Careers360 brings to you the overview, career opportunities & scope, top colleges offering the specialization and popular companies, which recruit Computer Science Engineering graduates.
 
Indian consumers have over the years moved to the online platform for carrying out basic and simple tasks like shopping, booking tickets, etc. According to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the year 2014 has seen unprecedented growth in E-commerce sector. Websites like Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon have been contributing in the economy of India over the last couple of years. The report mentions, “Since the E-commerce industry is fast rising, changes can be seen over a year. The sector in India has grown by 34% (CAGR) since 2009 to touch 16.4 billion USD in 2014. The sector is expected to be in the range of 22 billion USD in 2015.”
 
Incidentally, both the founders of Flipkart, one of the biggest E-commerce retail website, Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal are Computer Science Engineers from IIT Delhi.  Bhavish Agarwal, Co-Founder, Ola Cabs is also a graduate of Computer Science from IIT Bombay.</p>

<p>Computer Science Engineering – An Overview: Over the years, Indian engineers have contributed across the world in the field of
 Computer Science Engineering. From late 19th century, several Indians have been recruited by the IT majors like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, HCL, Cognizant, Accenture etc. They were even recruited in the famous Silicon Valley in USA by top companies like Yahoo!, Adobe, Apple Inc, Google, Intel, etc.
 
Computer and related services with a share of 3.3 per cent in India’s GDP grew by 14.4 per cent in 2013-14. Information technology and business process outsourcing are among the fastest-growing sectors, having a cumulative growth rate of revenue 33.6% between 1997-1998 and 2002-2003, and contributing to 25% of the country's total exports in 2007–08. The growth in the IT sector is attributed to increased specialisation, and an availability of a large pool of low cost, highly skilled, educated and fluent English-speaking workers, on the supply side, matched with the demand side by increased demand from foreign consumers interested in India's service exports, or those looking to outsource their operations. The share of the Indian IT industry in the country's GDP increased from 4.8% in 2005–06 to 7% in 2008.</p>

<p>What is Computer Science Engineering?
 
Computer Science engineering deals with design, implementation, and management of information system of both software & hardware processes. A computer scientist specializes in theory of computation and design of computational systems.
 
Computer engineering or Computer Science engineering integrates several disciplines such as Information Technology, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Software Design, etc. The engineers are mainly involved in the development of software and hardware systems of various aspects of computing. The engineers not only focus on how computers work but also integrate into larger scheme of things.
 
Amongst all the engineering branches, computer science has been found to be the most popular choice of students. This branch of engineering is perceived to be popular due to its research scopes (bio, mechanics, neuro-science, etc) and is known to be challenging while offering good career opportunities and remuneration. M Balakrishnan, professor (computer science and engineering, IIT-D) says that computer science & engineering has been the most sought after course in the past few years and in the current one too. 
 
The core courses for Computer Science Engineers are as follows:
Computer architecture and organization
Theory of computation
Database systems
Electronics
Operating systems
Computer Networks
Foundations of Computer Systems
Java Programming and Website Design
E-commerce & ERP and Multimedia Applications
Principles of Programming Languages
Software Engineering
Compiler Design
What do you do as Computer Science Engineer?
 
You can work in database management, IT, embedded systems, Telecommunication, computer hardware & software implementation & maintenance, multimedia, web designing, gaming, and almost all other industries in this sector.
It is worthwhile to note that the computer industry has witnessed such phenomenal growth in recent years that IT majors like Infosys & TCS have been the major recruiters across all other branches in engineering colleges of the country.</p>
<p>How to pursue Computer Science Engineering?
 
Aspirants of Computer Science Engineering must have appeared in 10+2 with Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics as core subjects. They have to appear for various Engineering Entrance Exams such as JEE (for IIT, NITs, IIITs, CFTIs and SFTIs), BITSAT (for BITS) and VITEEE (for VIT University) to name a few. On the basis of their performance and counselling, the candidates are allocated the engineering branch.

<p>Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly braces or keywords), and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.[22][23] The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.[24]

Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library.[25]

Python interpreters are available for many operating systems, allowing Python code to run on a wide variety of systems. CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software[26] and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.</p>
<p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s,[27] and its implementation began in December 1989[28] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL)[29] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the operating system Amoeba.[6] Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, benevolent dictator for life (BDFL).

About the origin of Python, Van Rossum wrote in 1996:[30]

Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).

Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 and had many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode. With this release the development process was changed and became more transparent and community-backed.[31]

Python 3.0 (which early in its development was commonly referred to as Python 3000 or py3k), a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on 3 December 2008[32] after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have been backported to the backwards-compatible Python 2.6.x[33] and 2.7.x version series.

The End Of Life date (EOL, sunset date) for Python 2.7 was initially set at 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code cannot easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[34][35] In January 2017 Google announced work on a Python 2.7 to Go transcompiler, which The Register speculated was in response to Python 2.7's planned end-of-life[36] but Google cited performance under concurrent workloads as their only motivation.[37]

Features and philosophy[edit]
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language: object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many language features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming[38] and metaobjects (magic methods)).[39] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[40][41] and logic programming.[42]

Python uses dynamic typing and a mix of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. An important feature of Python is dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.

The design of Python offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. The language has map(), reduce() and filter() functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, and sets; and generator expressions.[43] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[44]

The core philosophy of the language is summarized by the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[45]

Beautiful is better than ugly
Explicit is better than implicit
Simple is better than complex
Complex is better than complicated
Readability counts
Rather than requiring all desired functionality to be built into the language's core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. Python can also be embedded in existing applications that need a programmable interface. This design of a small core language with a large standard library and an easily extensible interpreter was intended by Van Rossum from the start because of his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite mindset.[27]

While offering choice in coding methodology, the Python philosophy rejects exuberant syntax, such as in Perl, in favor of a sparser, less-cluttered grammar. As Alex Martelli put it: "To describe something as clever is not considered a compliment in the Python culture."[46] Python's philosophy rejects the Perl "there is more than one way to do it" approach to language design in favor of "there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it".[45]

Python's developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and moreover, reject patches to non-critical parts of CPython that would offer a marginal increase in speed at the cost of clarity.[47] When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or try using PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.

An important goal of Python's developers is making it fun to use. This is reflected in the origin of the name, which comes from Monty Python,[48] and in an occasionally playful approach to tutorials and reference materials, such as using examples that refer to spam and eggs instead of the standard foo and bar.[49][50]

A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.

Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonists, Pythonistas, and Pythoneers.[51][52]

Syntax and semantics[edit]
Main article: Python syntax and semantics
Python is intended to be a highly readable language. It is designed to have an uncluttered visual layout, often using English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Further, Python has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.[53]

Indentation[edit]
Main article: Python syntax and semantics § Indentation
Python uses whitespace indentation to delimit blocks – rather than curly braces or keywords. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[54] This feature is also sometimes termed the off-side rule.

Statements and control flow[edit]
Python's statements include (among others):

The assignment statement (token '=', the equals sign). This operates differently than in traditional imperative programming languages, and this fundamental mechanism (including the nature of Python's version of variables) illuminates many other features of the language. Assignment in C, e.g., x = 2, translates to "typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2". The (right-hand) value is copied into an allocated storage location for which the (left-hand) variable name is the symbolic address. The memory allocated to the variable is large enough (potentially quite large) for the declared type. In the simplest case of Python assignment, using the same example, x = 2, translates to "(generic) name x receives a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object of numeric (int) type of value 2." This is termed binding the name to the object. Since the name's storage location doesn't contain the indicated value, it is improper to call it a variable. Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types, including strings, procedures, complex objects with data and methods, etc. Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names, e.g., x = 2; y = 2; z = 2 result in allocating storage to (at most) three names and one numeric object, to which all three names are bound. Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed data type with it. However at a given time a name will be bound to some object, which will have a type; thus there is dynamic typing.
The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if).
The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.
The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.
The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.
The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming.
The def statement, which defines a function or method.
The with statement (from Python 2.5), which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it), allowing Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)-like behavior.
The pass statement, which serves as a NOP. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.
The assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply.
The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function. From Python 2.5, yield is also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutines.
The import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program.
The print statement was changed to the print() function in Python 3.[55]
Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will.[56][57] However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's generators.[58] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. As of Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and as of Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.[59]

Expressions[edit]
Some Python expressions are similar to languages such as C and Java, while some are not:

Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. Python also added the ** operator for exponentiation.
As of Python 3.5, it supports matrix multiplication directly with the @ operator, versus C and Java, which implement these as library functions. Earlier versions of Python also used methods instead of an infix operator.[60][61]
In Python, == compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value[62] and objects by reference.[63] (Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the equals() method.) Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example a <= b <= c.
Python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic &&, ||, ! used in Java and C.
Python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension. Python 2.4 extended list comprehensions into a more general expression termed a generator expression.[43]
Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression.
Conditional expressions in Python are written as x if c else y[64] (different in order of operands from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages).
Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples are written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The parentheses around the tuple are optional in some contexts. Tuples can appear on the left side of an equal sign; hence a statement like x, y = y, x can be used to swap two variables.
Python has a "string format" operator %. This functions analogous to printf format strings in C, e.g. "spam=%s eggs=%d" % ("blah", 2) evaluates to "spam=blah eggs=2". In Python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. "spam={0} eggs={1}".format("blah", 2).</p>
